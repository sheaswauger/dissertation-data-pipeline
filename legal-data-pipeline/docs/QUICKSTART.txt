# Quick Start Guide

## Setup (do this once)

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## Run (every time)

```bash
./run.sh
```

That's it! The script will ask you for:
- Your LegiScan API key
- Path to keywords file (try `keywords_example.txt` first)
- Starting year (e.g., 2020) - will search from that year to present

Results will be in the `output/` folder.
